## Problem 1: Flip and Invert Image

- Flip each row of the binary matrix horizontally.
- Invert the image by replacing 0 with 1 and 1 with 0.
- Constraints: 1 <= n <= 20, image[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n^2) depending on implementation.

Example:  
Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]  
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

## Problem 2: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

- Calculate the maximum depth using DFS recursion.
- The depth is the number of nodes from root to the deepest leaf.
- Constraints: number of nodes in [0, 10^4], node values between -100 and 100.
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
- Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (recursive stack).

Example:  
Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
Output: 3
